    I’m Aryan Pradhan, a high school student passionate about computer science and data science. 
    This blog is where I share my journey - from projects and experiments to lessons learned and 
    insights gained along the way. My goal is to make my explorations accessible, so that anyone 
    curious about these fields can learn alongside me.
